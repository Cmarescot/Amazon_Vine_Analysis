# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 
### Purpse:
Amazon Vine is a program that enables companies to receive reviews on their products by requiring members to write a review. The purpose of this analysis was to perform the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process on a dataset of our choosing in order to determine if there were biases (paid vs unpaid) toward favorable reviews. 

## Results 
### Vine vs NonVine 
Out of all of our reviews.....
![part_of_vine]()
There were 0 Vine reviews and.... 
![not_part_of_vine]()
4532 noneVine reviews.

### 5 Start Reviews
![vine_stars]()
There were Vine reviews that were 5 stars
![nonvine_stars]()
There were NoneVine reviews that were 5 stars 

### 5 Start Percentages 

0% of the Vine reviews were 5 stars 
![nonvine_percentage]()
55.32% of the NoneVine reviews were 5 stars

## Summary 
### Bias?
From the result of our analysis there are no positivity biases between vine and nonvine reviews. There were more unpaid (nonvine) reviwes than there were vine reviews. In addition more than half of the unpaid reviews were positive (more than 5 stars).
### Additional Analysis to Perform 
In addition to this analysis we should look in to performing an analysis utilizing data with a total vote count of around 10. This can possibly help us at get at least some data on the paid (vine) program by not limiting our results to much.
